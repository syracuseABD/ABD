\label{chap:transitionSystems}

The main questions that are our focus are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What happens next, and why?
\item What happened and was it appropriate?
\end{enumerate}

The context in which we do this is at the levels of commands and
memory. This is at the same levels of abstraction as finite-state
machines and instruction-set architecture descriptions of behavior.
Both of these abstraction levels specify \emph{what services users
  see}.
