\chapter*{Preface}

This manual is meant to be a companion to the textbook \emph{Access
  Control, Security, and Trust: A Logical Approach}, \cite{ACST}, by
Chin and Older. We have embedded the syntax and semantics of the
access-control logic in \cite{ACST} in the Cambridge Higher-Order
Logic (HOL-4) theorem prover, \cite{HOL}. Additionally, we have
defined inference rules in HOL corresponding to the inference rules in
\cite{ACST}.
