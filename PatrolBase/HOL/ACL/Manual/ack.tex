\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Sue Older is co-author with Shiu-Kai Chin of the textbook \emph{Access
  Control, Security, and Trust: A Logical Approach}, CRC Press, 2011,
\cite{ACST}. This textbook was developed in large part due to Air
Force Research Laboratory's Advanced Course in Engineering
Cybersecurity Boot Camp. Lockwood Morris, Ph.D., Syracuse University
professor emeritus, provided much appreciated assistance in
implementing the access-control logic in the Cambridge Higher-Order
Logic (HOL-4) theorem prover, \cite{HOL}.

We are grateful to our students. They tested the access-control logic
and its implementation in HOL as part of the Air Force Research
Laboratory's Information Assurance Research Internship program and in
Syracuse University's Cyber Engineering Semester, \cite{OC12}.
